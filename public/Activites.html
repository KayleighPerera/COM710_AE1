      <td>Societies at Solent
          A society is a group of students with a common interest! There couldn't be a better or 
          easier way to make new friends with similar interests, or get involved in something completely new.
          Our societies represent a wide range of interests, from creative skills to political, from 
          religion to activism, to the whacky and wonderful, and everything in between. There's likely to be something you like the look of.
          Check out our list of active societies below, find out more information and how to contact them 
          by clicking through each one.Still unsure about joining a society? Take a look at our 10 REASONS TO 
          JOIN A SOCIETY booklet to read all about the benefits!If you have any questions about society memberships, 
          fees, or contacting the societies or anything else, please email student.involvement@solent.ac.uk.</td>

      <td>About Solent food garden
          Solent Food Garden is part of the Studentsâ€™ Union initiative, in partnership with Solent University, 
          to green up the university campus.Our food garden aims to create a safe space for people to hang out, 
          garden and grow. It is very common for university students to lack an outdoor space that they can make 
          their own and relax in, and we hope that the food garden provides this for our members!Our food garden is
          available to all students! However, only applicants can make changes and grow fruit, vegetables and herbs in the beds.
          In the food garden, there are 10 raised beds (two extra-high for those with back problems or for wheelchair access) and ground growing spaces.
          The area is locked to ensure that the space stays student and Solent staff-led. 
          Members of the food garden will have the access code.
